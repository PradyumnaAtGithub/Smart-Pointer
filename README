Notes on the SharedPtr program
------------------------------
My program has memory leaks so I have commented out the abort statements that are present after basic_test1(), basic_test2() and threaded_test().
I have included the test.cpp (with the commented memory leak abort statements).

The test.cpp program is written by Prof. Kenneth Chiu at Binghamton University, under whom I took the course.

Instructions to compile and run the programs
--------------------------------------------

	1. Run the SharedPtr.hpp - Type the following command,
		g++ test.cpp -o test.o -std=c++11 -ldl -lpthread
